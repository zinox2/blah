  After losing 98% of its value, the NFT ecosystem is not what it used to be
  during the last bull run, and degens are trying to recoup their losses, make
  some profit and forget their past mistakes! But nobody wants their NFTs
  anymore, this is why we created the Junkyard, the perfect solution for these
  issues! The Junkyard is a decentralized dump owned by a bunch of crazy rats.
  It's a place where you can throw away your shitty NFTs to clean your wallet
  while earning some Junkcoin, but it's also a nice way to try your luck at
  fishing some rare NFTs abandoned by degens in order to rescue the most
  valuable ones.
