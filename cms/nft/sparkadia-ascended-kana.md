  Sparkball is part of a larger universe called ‘Sparkadia’, an ecosystem of
  interconnected games all linked to the ‘Sparkadia’ IP, supported by transmedia
  elements such as books, anime, movies, and more. Our cozy-cosmic, optimistic
  world is ripe with incredibly fun characters you’re sure to love, and our
  first book, ‘GloKat and the Art of Timing’ is already out on Amazon!
