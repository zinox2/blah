  In the heart of New Orleans lies a tale of the mysterious voodoo queen, Marie
  Laveau, and her 2666 enchanted voodoo dolls. These dolls held the spirits of
  her followers, and each had a soul of its own. Legend has it that Marie Laveau
  created these dolls, imbuing them with magic that would last for generations.
  But one day, the dolls vanished into the swamps, leaving behind only whispers
  of their existence. This is the story of their creation and their enigmatic
  disappearance.
