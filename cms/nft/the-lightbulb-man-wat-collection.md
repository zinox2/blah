  So WATs going on?

  Created in the beginning of 2022, Melgaard's latest NFT collection, "The
  LightBulb Man," features 1025 unique works of art that showcase the artist's
  innovative and characteristically raw style. Each piece in the collection is
  its own, with extraordinary and hidden traits that make it distinct from the
  others. All of the art is based on Melgaardâ€™s original Lightbulb Man sculpture
  from 1997. At the core of The LightBulb Man collection is Melgaard's ability
  to challenge and disconcert the viewer in a way that only he can. The
  collection is a testament to his mastery of art that moves and challenges, and
  it is sure to captivate art enthusiasts and collectors alike.
