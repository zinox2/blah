  Players enter the ruthless lands known as the Sacrifice Zone where they
  compete to collect gear (in the form of NFTs) and a mysterious compound called
  Sigma. Players win by surviving long enough to reach one of several contested
  extraction points where they can escape with the loot and claim it as their
  own forever, but if they die, they lose it all. It’s the ultimate high stakes
  treasure hunting experience. Successfully extracted loot is placed in the
  player’s persistent inventory, which the player uses to build their loadout in
  future gameplay sessions.
